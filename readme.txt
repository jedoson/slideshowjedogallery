== Description ==

Slideshow provides an easy way to integrate multiple slideshows in any WordPress installation.

Any image can be loaded into a slideshow using the default WordPress media uploader, even images you've already
uploaded can be inserted into your slideshow right away!

Fancy doing something crazy? You can create and use as many slideshows as you'd like, with
different images, settings and styles for each one of them.
